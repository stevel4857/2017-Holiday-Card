# 2017-Holiday-Card

This is a holiday card that doubles as a 2D animated card and a Google cardboard VR card. It has snow particle effects and a GLTF model. The two buttons show how to modify the animation for the rotation. I have both start and stop function. Crazy how this isn't documented as an example in A-Frame for start and stop. See also my Javascript tests.  

The characters follow movement of the camera. The alpha issues with overlapping png files was solved by Kevin Nygo who wrote the AfRame component code for that fix. 

Thanks to all who contribute to A-Frame and three.js.
