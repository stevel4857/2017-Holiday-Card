# 2017-Holiday-Card

This is a holiday card that doubles as a 2D animated card and a Google cardboard VR card. It has snow particle effects and a GLTF model. The two buttons show how to modify the animation for the rotation bot start and stop. 

The characters follow movement of the camera. The alpha issues with overlapping png files was solved by Kevin Nygo who wrote the AFRame component code for that fix. 

Thanks to all who contribute to A-Frame and three.js.
